----------------------------

** This is an example code for the algorithm described in

Zhuolin Jiang, Zhe Lin, Larry S. Davis.
"Learning A Discriminative Dictionary for Sparse Coding via Label Consistent K-SVD", CVPR 2011.

***************************************

1. To run the example code: 
(a) add the toolbox paths 'ksvdbox' and 'OMPbox' into the matlab path;

  addpath(genpath('.\OMPbox'));
  addpath(genpath('.\ksvdbox'));

* Please note that you might need to recompile these two toolboxes once you use Linux or Mac OS.
You can simply run these two files within matlab:
./OMPbox/private/make.m
./ksvdbox/private/make.m

(b) run main.m

The mat file 'featurevector' in the folder 'trainingdata' is one random split of training data and testing data 
on the Extended YaleB dataset. The recognition results of this example should be:

  Final recognition rate for LC-KSVD1 is : 0.945 
  Final recognition rate for LC-KSVD2 is : 0.950


2. About the selection of parameter "sqrt_alpha" and "sqrt_beta", they are determined according to 
the classificaiton performance for training data. They can be different for different databases. 
You can change it if the classification performance is not satisfying. The current setting 
is good for Extended Yaleb face database. For the caltech101 dataset, "sqrt_alpha" and  "sqrt_beta" is about 0.001.


3. About the inputs for dictionary learning prcoess, training features and their labels should be matrice. 
For example, 

  training_feats: nXN (n: feature dimensions, N: number of training samples);
  H_train: mxN (m: number of classes, N: number of training samples)

* Note that H_train is a label matrix, each column corresponds to a training feature vector, where the 
non-zero position of each column indicates the classes of feature vectors.
